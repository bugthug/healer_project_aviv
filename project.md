# Trying to encode Hebrew messages, LET'S A GO!
The first thing is to try JSONing in Reverse. Hebrew is an RTL langugage, so a reverse might do the trick. We'll first try to explore how Hebrew is handled within json tradionally.

Then, if that doesn't work, we'll go deep. How is Hebrew encoded in modern systems? It is probably UTF-8, which is unicode, which is a bit more difficult.

We'll try to encode json files in UTF8 as a first step.

Ok, let's go!
